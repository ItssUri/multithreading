# Multithreading Horse Race

Welcome to the Multithreading Steel Ball Run! This program simulates a horse race using multithreading, where multiple racers compete against each other in a fun and interactive console application.

## Features

- Simulates a horse race with multiple characters racing simultaneously.
- Utilizes multithreading to allow each racer to operate independently.
- Console output to visualize the race in real-time.
- Customizable race parameters, including track length and racer characteristics.

## Compilation

To compile the program, you will need a C++ compiler like `g++`. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o horse_race main.cpp
```

Replace `main.cpp` with the name of your source file if it's different.

## Usage

After compiling the program, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./horse_race
```

Upon execution, you will be greeted with a welcome message, and the race will commence, displaying the progress of each racer in the console.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
